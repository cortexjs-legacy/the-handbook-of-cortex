[Cortex](http://ctx.io) is the ultimate solution to front end development and a package manager for browsers.

It helps you write modular, resusable packages for browsers, which are not just javascript, but also including css, images, fonts, and etc.

Cortex offers:
* A [registry cloud](http://ctx.io) for package management.
* [Command-line tool](https://github.com/cortexjs/cortex) that covers everything from development to production.
* Let you write code **EXACTLY** in the nodejs way, just use `require()`, no module wrapping needed.
* Smart versioning system with fully [SemVer](http://semver.org) and SemVer [ranges](https://github.com/isaacs/node-semver#ranges) support.
* A powerful yet simple-to-use module/resource loader

Cortex is especially suitable for large projects because it helps us break down the logic into modular pieces.

Small projects could also benefit from cortex, just install our best buddy jquery, or bootstrap, then focus on the work to bring your brilliant ideals into reality!
