# Semantic Versioning

Cortex fully support [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org), thus making it trivial work to deliver a patched or bug fixed version without touching the code.

Open cortex.json, check the `dependencies` field:

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "jquery": "^1.9.2"
  }
}
```

When you install some dependency, by default the `^` operators is used, meaning "depend on the latest version compact with".

If you want to use a specifed version or define a different range, just edit the field and re-run `cortex install`. Cortex will ask for the registry and find the proper version.
